# Cleaning and Getting Data Project

The script for the project is in the file *run_analysis.R*. This script does the following:

1. Import all the necessary files that comprise the training and test data.
2. Merge all the files for creating a single dataset for the test and training data.
3. Merge the test and training data into a complete dataset.
4. Filter all the activities that use mean or standard deviation.
5. Rename activities and features so they are easier to understand.
6. Creates a tidy dataset in which the Subject and the Activity are the ID, and the mean of each feature is the value shown
7. Writes the tidy dataset into the *tidydata.txt* file.
